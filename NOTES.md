## Design Patterns

### SOLID design pattern
- Single Responsibility
    - Each class should do only one job
- Open/Closed Principle
    - Open for extension
    - closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution Principle
    - Superclass should be replaceable by subclasses
- Interface Segregation Principle
    - Not interact with unnecessary interfaces
- Dependency Inversion
    - High level modules do not rely on low level modules
